# IS607_Final_Project
Final Project for IS 607 - H. Berk, S. Hong, J. Hamski

Social media has become a key communication platform for professional skills development, in addition to a place to share selfies and rants. 
For our final project, we aim to analyze the R Project for Statistical Computing (R) community on Twitter to uncover insights into how influence is held and information is shared. 
This project will also showcase a variety of skills developed through IS607, including the use of Rest APIs, the R programming language and the neo4j graph database.
